# Writing — Protocol 2 (drafting written content)

This skill executes Protocol 2: drafting written content on a branch with planning loops, one-pass drafting, and document-level finalization, after the triage in `writing_skill.md` has identified the work as drafting-mode (rather than thinking-mode in Protocol 1).

For shared context (when to use either protocol, how the protocols interact, project-setup parameters), see `writing_skill.md`. This file carries only the Protocol 2 workflow.

## When this skill applies

The triage in `writing_skill.md` identified the work as drafting-mode. The user wants to produce a written deliverable — a section, chapter, policy note, report, or any substantial document.

The protocol does **not** apply to:
- Note-taking from sources — use `writing_notes_skill.md` (Protocol 1).
- Short writes that don't earn an outline step — emails, short talking points, brief messages, single-slide bullets. These are drafted inline without a branch.

The trigger for Protocol 2 is the outline, not the artifact type. If the work earns an outline, the work earns a branch.

## Core principle

Plan interactively, draft in one pass on a branch, review on the branch, check structure with a compiled outline before merging. This yields better prose than drafting with inline approval gates, because Claude can manage flow and coherence across the full drafting unit; and it catches structural drift between plan and prose before the document lands in `main`.

**The outline-to-branch rule.** If you're following this protocol — building an outline before drafting — the work goes on a branch from step 1 onward, per `writing_branch_skill.md`. Outline file, drafts, compiled outline + review, all on the branch. Inline drafting (no branch) is for short writes that don't earn an outline step (the cases listed above).

**Overriding the branch is allowed, but not silent.** If Andrea judges a piece short enough to skip the branch ("this is one page, let's just draft it here"), draft it inline — but first remind her, once, what the branch buys: review comments that don't scroll past in chat, the compiled-outline-and-divergence record, and `main` staying stable through the iteration. Note that skipping the branch on a "short" piece has not always worked out. She can still override and you proceed inline; the reminder is the protocol's job, the decision is hers — exactly as with the scale check.

## Unit of work

A Protocol 2 instance is scoped to one **outline unit** — whatever the user outlines at step 1. Outline units can be at any level (section, chapter, full document); the user picks based on the work at hand. The **drafting unit** for that instance is one level below the outline unit:

- Outline unit = section → drafting unit = subsection.
- Outline unit = chapter → drafting unit = section.
- Outline unit = full document → drafting unit = chapter.

**Containers.** Every outline unit fits inside a known **container** — a larger structural whole that the outline unit is a piece of. Sections are pieces of chapters; chapters are pieces of full documents. The container does not need its own active Protocol 2 instance — it can exist as a skeleton outline that names its children and sketches their intended scope. But the container has to exist before a Protocol 2 instance fires on one of its children, because that's what makes the child work coherent.

Practically: if the user is going to draft section A2 of a chapter, the chapter A outline exists first — at minimum as a skeleton listing the sections (A1, A2, A3, ...) and their intended scope. The chapter skeleton lives in `main` as `A_chapter_<name>_OUTLINE.md` and is updated as sections get drafted. Drafting section A2 does not redraft the chapter outline; it draws context from it.

The container concept is what makes assembly cycles (described below) possible: when sections A1, A2, A3 have each been drafted in their own Protocol 2 instances, the chapter container has been populated, and the assembly cycle is the chapter's own Protocol 2 instance — using the now-existing section drafts as inputs.

**Re-instances, not iterations.** If the user later wants to assemble completed outline units into a higher-level whole (e.g., three finished sections into a chapter), **that is a new Protocol 2 instance** — new outline, new branch, new compiled-outline-and-review cycle. The completed pieces feed in as already-existing material to step 2 of the new instance, not as work to redraft. See Assembly cycles below.

## Assembly cycles

An **assembly cycle** is a Protocol 2 instance whose purpose is to combine already-completed outline units (drafted in their own prior Protocol 2 instances) into a higher-level whole — e.g., three finished sections into a chapter, several finished chapters into a full document. Assembly cycles run the full Protocol 2 machinery but with three named variations:

**1. The scale check at step 1 is suspended.** The 10k-word flag exists to keep drafting-from-scratch cycles disciplined; in assembly, the bulk of the prose already exists and has already been through its own per-piece Protocol 2 cycle (each respecting the scale cap). The drift/fatigue logic that justifies the flag does not apply. The user declares the cycle as an assembly cycle when proposing the outline at step 1; the scale check is skipped.

**2. Step 2 (per-drafting-unit prospective outline) is lighter.** For drafting units that are pre-existing files, there is no prospective outline to build — the file already exists with its own approved outline from its prior cycle. Step 2 in assembly becomes: review the existing piece's structure, decide how it slots into the higher-level container, identify integration edits needed (terminology harmonization, transitions, cross-references). For *new* connective material in the assembly (introduction, conclusion, bridging passages that didn't exist before), step 2 runs normally as a prospective outline.

**3. Step 4 (drafting pass) is replaced by step 5 (collaborative integration).** The "drafting step is NOT interactive" rule does not carry over to assembly. Integration work — applying edits to existing prose, drafting new bridges, harmonizing voice — uses the branch skill's standard editing flow (bracketed comments + direct edits), which is collaborative and iterative by design. New connective material can still be drafted in one pass per Protocol 2's normal step 4 rules; it's the integration of pre-existing prose that is collaborative.

**What stays the same.** The branch is created at step 1 (after the outline is approved). Steps 6–7 (overall outline check, repeat) still apply when assembly is iterating across multiple drafting units. **Steps 8–12 run fully**: the document-level finalization (compile descriptive outline + divergence table → outline review → re-read → joint approval → merge → ask about branch deletion) is arguably more important in assembly than in fresh-draft cycles, because that's where the assembled-whole's coherence is checked.

**Starting outline in an assembly cycle.** At step 1, Claude composes a starting outline of the higher-level whole by reading the constituent `_OUTLINE.md` files of the pieces being assembled (from `main`). Claude proposes a chapter-level (or document-level) structure built from those constituent outlines; the user reacts and reshapes — just like regular Protocol 2 step 1. Decisions made here include: ordering of the pieces, where bridges are needed, what intro/conclusion is required, what the through-line is, what terminology needs harmonizing.

**What lives on the branch.** At step 2 of an assembly cycle, Claude copies each constituent piece file (e.g., `A1_section_*.md`, `A2_section_*.md`, `A3_section_*.md`) from `main` to the branch and concatenates them into a new file at the higher level (e.g., `A_chapter_<name>.md`). The assembled starting outline lives as the companion file (`A_chapter_<name>_OUTLINE.md`). Integration edits happen on the chapter file on the branch.

**After merge.** Both the assembled chapter file and the piece files coexist in `main`. The piece files remain as the per-piece deliverables they were; the chapter is a *new* deliverable composed from them, with the integration edits, connective tissue, and reordering decisions that emerged during assembly. Drift management (edits to a piece file in `main` after assembly not propagating to the chapter) is handled by `project_tracker_skill.md`'s STATUS.md "Pending re-integrations" subsection.

## Workflow

1. **Overall outline of the outline unit.** Claude proposes a structure. The user and Claude work on it interactively until the user is satisfied.
    - **Scale check before branching.** Once the outline is agreed, Claude estimates the implied document length: number of drafting units × typical drafting-unit length (from the project's CLAUDE.md "Drafting-unit sizing" entry; ask the user if not specified). If the estimate exceeds **~10,000 words / ~25 pages**, Claude surfaces the estimate and suggests splitting the outline into smaller outline units, each as its own Protocol 2 instance. The decision is the user's — Claude does not split unilaterally. The flag is information; the discipline is on the user. *Assembly cycles suspend this check (see above).*
    - **Branch creation.** Once the outline is approved and the scale check is complete (split decision made if applicable), create a branch per `writing_branch_skill.md` Step 1. The outline file is committed to the branch; all subsequent work happens there. If the deliverable's home folder isn't already established, settle it here per the **Placement is asked, not assumed** rule (ask, then suggest from the repo's `FOLDER_MAP`s) before committing the outline file.
2. **Detailed outline of the next drafting unit.** Before drafting, build a detailed outline for the drafting unit to be written next: key arguments, evidence to cite, sources to reference, internal structure, and approximate length. Interactive — Claude proposes, the user shapes. Committed to the branch when agreed. *In assembly cycles, this step is lighter for pre-existing pieces — see above.*
3. **Agree on length.** Based on the detailed outline, agree on a target length for the drafting unit. Happens during step 2.
4. **Claude drafts the full drafting unit on the branch.** One pass, no mid-draft checkpoints. Claude writes the complete drafting unit based on the approved detailed outline and commits it to the branch. Per-write narration is not needed during drafting on the branch — the branch is the show-before-committing mechanism. *In assembly cycles, this step is replaced by step 5 mechanics for pre-existing pieces.*
5. **Review on the branch.** The user reviews using the bracketed-comments + direct-edits mechanics in `writing_branch_skill.md` Step 2. Claude applies edits and proofreads (Step 4 of the branch skill). Iterate until the drafting unit is approved.
6. **Check the overall outline.** After finishing a drafting unit, step back: does the overall outline still hold? Has writing this unit revealed that something downstream needs to change? Update the outline on the branch if needed.
7. **Repeat** from step 2 for the next drafting unit, until all units in the outline are drafted, reviewed, and approved.
8. **Compile a full detailed outline of the finished document.** Once all drafting units are done, Claude produces a **descriptive outline of what was actually written** — section/subsection headings, the actual arguments made in each drafting unit, evidence cited, transitions used. This is a *post-hoc* outline, not the prospective plan.
    - Also produce a **divergence table** comparing the post-hoc outline to the plan (the original overall outline from step 1 plus the per-unit detailed outlines from step 2 iterations). Columns: drafting unit · what the plan said · what the draft did · status (intentional / drift / unclear) · note for future Andrea.
    - The compiled outline (with divergence table) is saved to the branch as a companion file. Naming follows the user's project conventions: same basename as the draft with an `_OUTLINE` suffix (e.g., `policy_note_vat.md` and `policy_note_vat_OUTLINE.md`).
9. **Outline review.** The user reviews the compiled outline first. The divergence table is where the user marks divergences as intentional (with a note for future Andrea explaining why), drift (to be corrected), or unclear (needs a final-pass decision). Edits to the outline and the table happen on the branch via the branch skill's mechanics. Iterate until the user approves the outline.
10. **Full-document re-read.** Once the outline is approved, the user reads the document end to end and makes any final adjustments. Adjustments happen on the branch. The compiled outline may be updated again if final adjustments shift the structure.
11. **Joint approval of outline and draft.** Both files (`<name>.md` and `<name>_OUTLINE.md`) are approved together as a pair. The pair is the deliverable.
12. **Merge.** Both files merge to `main` — into the deliverable's established home (see **Placement is asked, not assumed**) — per `writing_branch_skill.md` Step 6 — the draft and its `_OUTLINE.md` companion, which carries the divergence table and the reasoning behind it (the intentional-vs-drift calls and the notes for future Andrea). Before asking whether to delete the branch, Claude confirms that `_OUTLINE.md` has actually landed in `main`. The divergence reasoning is the hardest thing to reconstruct, and deleting the branch destroys anything branch-only — so the deletion question is asked only once that record is confirmed merged. Then Claude asks whether to delete the branch (per the branch skill's Step 6 instruction).

## Key rules

- **The outline unit is the user's choice.** Section, chapter, full document — whichever scope makes sense for the current work. Re-scoping mid-instance is not supported; if a different outline unit is needed, start a new instance.
- **The drafting unit is one level below the outline unit.** Step 4 produces one drafting unit in one pass.
- **The scale check at step 1 is a discipline rule.** When the outline implies more than ~10,000 words / ~25 pages, Claude is expected to flag — every time, without softening. The user can override after seeing the estimate; the flag is the protocol's job. Assembly cycles suspend the check.
- **Planning steps (1–3, repeated per drafting unit) are interactive.** Do not skip the outline or jump to drafting. The outline work is where the user thinks through the project — it's not overhead, it's the point.
- **The drafting step (4) is NOT interactive in regular cycles.** Claude produces the full drafting unit in one pass on the branch. This yields better prose (coherent flow, no repetition, consistent argument). **Named exception: assembly cycles** replace step 4 with collaborative integration (step 5 mechanics), since the prose to be integrated already exists. The one-pass rule still applies to *new* connective material drafted within an assembly cycle.
- **Review uses the branch skill's mechanics, not inline chunk review in chat.**
- **Outlines are living documents.** Updated as writing reveals new structural needs (step 6). Always push updated outlines to the branch.
- **Final review is at the document level, not the drafting-unit level.** Steps 8–11 add a document-level pass that catches drift the per-unit review can't catch.
- **The compiled outline ships with the draft.** Both files are part of the deliverable. The outline lives in `main` as a companion artifact and is the durable record of structural choices made during drafting.
- **Placement is asked, not assumed.** The deliverable's output folder is never hardcoded or inferred from the repo's archetype. When the draft's home isn't already established — at branch creation (step 1), confirmed at merge (step 12) — Claude asks where it lands and *suggests by reading the repo's `FOLDER_MAP.md` files*, the distributed index of every folder's purpose present in every repo regardless of archetype. `Drafts/` is at most an illustrative example, never a default. This keeps the skill archetype-blind: it behaves identically in research / coordination / operation / NONE repos and needs no edit when a spec changes its folders.

## Why this works

The insight behind this protocol: Claude produces better writing in larger passes, but the user produces better thinking in tighter loops. The protocol separates these two activities — tight loops for planning, larger passes for prose — so each party does what they're best at.

The overall outline → detailed outline → draft → review cycle helps the user think through the project incrementally. Each detailed outline forces a decision about what a drafting unit will argue. This surfaces structural problems early, before prose is written, when they're cheap to fix.

The compiled outline at step 8 catches structural problems that the per-unit cycle can't catch: drift between plan and prose, unintended repetition across units, transitions that don't connect, an overall arc that turned out different from the planned arc. The divergence table makes intentional structural choices durable — future Andrea reading the outline finds the reasoning for each non-obvious choice in the notes column.

The scale check is a discipline mechanism. It exists because outlines that grow beyond ~10,000 words tend to produce drafts that lose coherence — too many drafting units to hold in mind, too long a feedback loop between plan and finished document, too much drift accumulating before the document-level review can catch it. Splitting into smaller outline units restores the tight planning loop on each piece. The user can override when overriding is right (a genuinely single-argument long piece, a format constraint, a time constraint); the protocol's job is to make sure the trade-off is visible.

The branch makes the review machinery first-class. Comments don't scroll past in chat; intermediate state is version-controlled; `main` stays stable through the iteration.

The choice of outline unit is a trade-off the user manages: larger units give better overall coherence but make each drafting pass heavier and risk hitting the scale threshold; smaller units keep drafting passes manageable but require a separate Protocol 2 instance to assemble higher levels. The writing-branch workflow makes review on either scale tractable.

## Project-specific parameters

For project-specific parameters (deliverable format, style profiles, version control, drafting-unit sizing, lookup order), see `writing_skill.md`'s "Setting up for a new project" section — the canonical source.

The most important parameter for Protocol 2 is **drafting-unit sizing** — it calibrates step 3 (agree on length) and the scale check at step 1. If the project hasn't defined drafting-unit sizing when Protocol 2 fires, ask the user at outline approval.

## Composition with other skills

- **`writing_skill.md`** — Parent triage skill. Routes here when the active mode is drafting work. Carries shared content: how the two protocols interact, project-setup parameters.
- **`writing_notes_skill.md`** — Sibling skill for Protocol 1. Not invoked from this skill; the choice between protocols happens upstream (the user signals which mode they're in).
- **`writing_branch_skill.md`** — Used from step 1 onward. Outline file, drafts, compiled outline, and review all live on the branch.
- **`project_tracker_skill.md`** — Deliverable folders are covered by the freshness audit's recursive `FOLDER_MAP.md` scan in `TRACKED_LOCATIONS`, wherever the archetype places them. Branch creation, commits, and merges are picked up by the session-start audit. STATUS.md's "Pending re-integrations" subsection tracks drift between section files and assembled chapter files.
- **Style profile skills** (`andrea_writing_style_skill.md`, `andrea_fmm_institutional_style_skill.md`, `marta_writing_voice_skill.md`) — Applied at user request, typically as a second pass after drafting in plain style.
- **`fmm_docx_formatting_skill.md`**, **`academic_paper_latex_skill.md`**, **`fmm_coordination_slides_latex_skill.md`**, **`fmm_coordination_slides_pptx_skill.md`**, **`academic_slides_skill.md`** — Format-specific skills invoked after the markdown draft is approved in `main` (companion artifacts are built from `main`, not on the branch).
- **`visuals_workflow_skill.md`** (repo-local in `SimplifiedRegimen`) — When the deliverable includes visuals (figures, diagrams, charts) embedded inside a markdown narrative or slide, invoked during drafting to spec each visual as a sketch-plus-description in the markdown, then iterated as SVG post-merge before format-specific compilation. Does not apply to whole-slide compositions (those stay with the slides skills).

*Last updated: June 8, 2026 — v2.0.0 (v4 cycle, #8 branch/exploration build: `branch_workflow_skill.md` references renamed to `writing_branch_skill.md` (the writing-branch half of the branch_workflow split), and the prose reference to “the branch workflow” tightened to “the writing-branch workflow”; behavior unchanged. Stamped at the v2.0.0 floor; final v4 stamp at cycle close. Prior: June 6, 2026 — v2.0.0 (v4 bin-1 placement slice: added the **Placement is asked, not assumed** rule — the deliverable's output folder is never hardcoded or inferred from the archetype; at branch creation (step 1) and merge (step 12) Claude asks where it lands and suggests by reading the repo's `FOLDER_MAP`s, keeping this skill archetype-blind. Updated the `project_tracker` composition pointer. Hierarchical draft-file naming unchanged — it is this skill's own filename scheme, not a folder rule. Carries the v2.0.0 floor; final stamp at the v4 re-baseline. Prior: May 29, 2026 — v2.0.0 (v3.2 batch D: two edits — (1) branch-skip override reminder added to the outline-to-branch rule (allowed but not silent, mirroring the scale-check discipline: skipping the branch on a "short" piece has not always worked out); (2) step 12 now gates the branch-deletion question on the `_OUTLINE.md` divergence record being confirmed merged to `main`. Marker floored to the v2.0.0 cycle baseline; the two stacked markers collapsed to one. Prior: v3.1 (May 28, 2026 — added `visuals_workflow_skill.md` to the Composition list); v1.0 (May 13, 2026 — extracted from `writing_skill.md` v1.1 in the v2.1.7/v3.0 writing split, Protocol 2 unmodified; all v2.1.1 machinery preserved: branch workflow, scale check, hierarchical naming, assembly cycles, document-level finalization with compiled outline + divergence table).).)*

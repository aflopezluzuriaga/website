		<h2>About this website</h2>
		<p> As a development economist, I think it's important to consider the availability of resources in the developing world.  This site is designed to be lightweight and fast, even for viewers with poor internet connection, while also functional on mobile devices.  Links to large files (images or pdf) are clearly indicated.
		</p>
		<p> This site was inspired by <a href="https://kevinhayeswilson.com/">Kevin H. Wilson</a> and <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"> this NSFW website</a>.  The code for this website is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/danparshall/andreasite">GitHub</a>.

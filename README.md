## About Andrea's website

Academic websites are a niche design space.  They don't need to be updated regularly, they don't need to be complicated, and most of the automatic website generation tools are serious overkill.

As a development economist, she works regularly in the developing world, and I think it's important to consider resources there.  So I designed Andrea's website to be fast and simple, even for viewers with a poor internet connection (which also includes mobile users).

Links to large files (images or pdf) or to external pages are clearly indicated, to prevent surprise downloads.

This site was inspired by <a href="https://kevinhayeswilson.com/">Kevin H. Wilson</a> and this <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"> (mildly) NSFW website</a>.  

If you change the background or fonts, you should check the contrast using a resource such as <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">this</a> one.
